* Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (also called the target or response variable) and one or more independent variables (also called predictors or features). It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable, meaning that changes in the independent variables are associated with proportional changes in the dependent variable.
* In this program we have determined the value of mileage of various cars with the help of other independent variables.
* When the number of attributes and their permutation combinations are more and the data points are less then this situation is known as curse of dimensionality.
* This leads to overfitting over the training set which results in poor performance over test set, thus making the model unfit for production.
* To fix this we can either use ridge regression or lasso regression.
* In lasso and ridge regression an extra factor is added which is multiplied by a penalty term, this penalty term reduces the magnitude of the coefficient or slopes of the graph thereby converting the sharp peaks and valleys to smooth bends and curves in the graph.
* however in ridge model the coefficients cannot be reduced to 0 while in lasso model the coefficients are reduced to 0.
* so the lasso model also decreases the complexity of the program while providing similar or even better accuracy with less attributes than the other 2 models
